I feel that CC189 can be used to learn different data structures. It is fine. However, it is difficult to improve code. After learning everything here, Leetcode should be the place to do accelerations.

Array and string
1_1, 1_2

Finished section 1
1_3, 1_5, 1_6, 1_7 is fine for Python. 1_7 is like LC048

Started Section2 - Linked List
It is important to learn linked list implentation because:
1. Other data structure can be done by doing the similar procedures
2. Learn how to code classes, and functions in classes.
It is still important to learn to code classes externally, and import it into my current code.
2_1, 2_2. Questions are not so difficult. Learning linked list implementation is more important.
