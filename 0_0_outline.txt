I feel that CC189 can be used to learn different data structures. It is fine. However, it is difficult to improve code. After learning everything here, Leetcode should be the place to do accelerations.

Array and string
1_1, 1_2

Finished section 1
1_3, 1_5, 1_6, 1_7 is fine for Python. 1_7 is like LC048

Started Section2 - Linked List
It is important to learn linked list implentation because:
1. Other data structure can be done by doing the similar procedures
2. Learn how to code classes, and functions in classes.
It is still important to learn to code classes externally, and import it into my current code.
2_1, 2_2. Questions are not so difficult. Learning linked list implementation is more important.

2_3,2_4,2_5,2_6 not so difficult.
1. We can write linked_list function based on what we need, for example, we can remove item by 'element' or by 'index'
2. Useful to know why we need getNext, getData, setNext, setData. What if we are not allowed to use it?
3. Learn more about general info about linked list. for example, intersecting, circular linked list
4. Clarify the head and bottom of linked list ... In 2_7 especially, they said from somewhere to bottom, the linked lists can be the same, then they are intersected. What the the bottom here? Is that the newly added items? or the oldest ones?

2_7,2_8. Takeaways and summary refer to 04/04.
Starting Section 3 - Stack and Queue

04/21/2019
A brief summary of section3,4 and 5
3_1, 3_2, 3_3, 3_4, 3_5: They ask you to implement different stacks and queues to achieve different functions. It is a good practice of making classes.
3_6: same. If using Python, there is no need to use Linked List, which they mentioned in the quesiton.

Section 4 is very important. Tree and Grpah.
I still should practise more on making Vertex and Graph classes. Implementing trees is easy, but it worths repeating.
4_1: good example to understand graph, how vertices are connected and how to operate in a graph data structure
4_2 and more:  Considering that recursion and iteration are used a lot in tree and graph questions, I will come back after finishing those sections (Section 8)
It is important to do some more on operating tree and graph, such as search tree, BFS, DFS, etc. The coursera class may help.

Section 5 is about bit manipulation, binary operations. It is helpful to learn those binary calculation rules. For example, if you multiple a binary number by 2, it is like moving all bits to their left.
All questions in section 5 is easy. 
Do not know what 5_4 and 5_8 is talking about. Skipped.
